this place is only relevant if you are planning on training (gl).
the dataset is just a single big .txt file and is going to be read just like a normal text file.
so if the dataset looks like:

human: bla bla bla
network: yap yap yap
etc...

your model will mimic this pattern
if it has freeform-style text, the network will mimic that.

*remember: when you are training a new REAN model, you HAVE to make sure it matches your word2vec.
and a new word2vec wont work on older REAN models.
